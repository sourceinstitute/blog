Pete's Coffee is a great place to be in Nairobi.  Tasty food, fast service, and a great location. It's the only restuarant in Bishop Magua Centre, which it shares with iHub, mLab, Kopo Kopo, FrontlineSMS, BRCK, Ushahidi, AkiraChix, Savannah Fund, and M Farm. These are some East Africa's biggest tech successes. Grab a coffee, sit back, and listen.  You're right in the middle of the buzzing hub for the movers and shakers in Nairobi's tech scene.

I was there a few months ago, running the training for [The Africa Prize For Engineering](http://africaprize.co). Our training happened to coincide with visits from Uber and Facebook.  You could tell they were foreigners solely from the whirlwind they created, and their fast-paced pitching style as they cycled through meeting after meeting.

I recognised this from my time in London, when US businesses would head over, using the UK as an entry market to Europe. Usually the people they sent were junior, ambitious and craving adventure. They were all ambitious businesses that had scaled to greatness in one of the largest markets in the world. Their stumbling blocks were consistent too - they'd run their North American playbook in a new place, expecting similar results.

They'd recruit locals to help, but give them little leeway to do what worked locally. Most of them failed because - to their surprise - the UK is very different from the US.

Back to Nairobi, the talk outside of Pete's was a little more relaxed and open.

The running joke was that Uber was the new Domino's Pizza.  Domino's famously flopped by offering their standard guarantee - delivered 30 minutes or it's free. Everybody knows: 30 minutes doesn't get you very far in Nairobi. Uber was compounding that in a few more ways - insulting the local market with their "low-end" Uber X brand and interpretting local smartphone and data usage rates through Western assumptions.

The problem was their somewhat superior attitude.  A lot of Uber's local supporters were unable to do what Uber needed because, as an organisation, they underestimated the importance of local adaptation. They were the smart guys coming to show the locals how it's done. The general feeling was that working with Uber was probably not a good long-term career move since they'd likely fail, but you might as well take their money before they flop.

It's easy to see this from the perspective of a local watching a foreigner trip, but local tech companies are making similar mistakes themselves.

Importing technology and startup knowhow also imports their inherent assumptions.  For example, the latest programming techniques can put your web app on the cutting edge, but using them cuts out most African users.  Why?  The required files are designed for fast connections to nearby servers.  This is not the case in Africa - these files are all hosted in the US or Europe - so while the stats show that Africa is covered by 3G and fast, 30MPS connections, the result for Africans is still a painfully slow web experience. 

Meanwhile, there are local technology entrepreneurs who understand the local environment enough to build tech giants.  Nigeria's Interswitch is valued over a biliion US dollars. Kenya's M-KOPA is growing fast - already at 700 employees. Then, there are all the early-stage innovators with equal potential.  Just look at [The Africa Prize](http://africaprize.co) and [Meltwater Incubator](http://meltwater.org).

These African innovators have alot in common with other innovators who have claimed global dominance - the Xerox machine, Google's search, Nespresso, the iPod. They have had unprecedented business models. They couldn't copy-and-paste from somewhere else. They had to figure it out for themselves. They had to be fast and brave at trying new things. They had to recognise the unique window of opportunity right in front of them, a sieze the moment.

The world is changing fast, and we're finding ourselves in uncertain territory.  More and more, even our home markets are are uncertain. Yet, they still hold some of the strongest potential - high-growth markets that are used to pre-pay, and adopt new technology. This only exists in Africa.

Our job is to use this to our full advantage, and recognise that this is a unique opportunity requiring a unique approach.

Let's promise ourselves not to be like Uber in Africa.
