There’s a famous saying that if the person you’re shaking hands with is staring at your shoes, then it’s likely to be an engineer. Of course this is an exaggeration, but it is funny, and telling to a certain degree for the introverted nature of the engineering profession.

The geeky slant to the profession aside, engineers are behind some of humanity's greatest advancements, automobiles, the green revolution, the internet, etc. Engineering is a force to reckoned with!

Yet despite the value that society has gained from the profession, engineering is under pressure. Research budgets are declining, and engineering projects need to increasingly account for impact; people in the real world benefitting directly from the research that is being done.

In this context, the power of entrepreneurship is a force that holds the potential for resolve. By combining entrepreneurship with the engineering profession an interesting strategy comes to light to to adapt to this new circumstance. What if engineers are equipped with the entrepreneurial skills to also launch the value of their inventions into the real world?

At the [Leaders in Innovation Fellowship Program](http://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-and-prizes/international-research-and-collaborations/newton-fund-programmes/leaders-in-innovation-fellowships) of the Royal Academy of Engineering, [Source Institute](http://source.institute) is working on creating this profile for the engineer of the future. In this program we have the opportunity to work with a knowledgeable group of engineers, who is motivated to create impact on the world, and are keen to learn about the entrepreneurial way to do so. 

The technology ideas, range from sugar substitutes that regulate the body’s insulin production, to smart coatings that reinforce glass, to male undergarments that help during the recovery process of circumcision. 

We would like to call out to the world with this post, to all the engineers of the world who are looking for impact in their work. Join us in this ongoing, and [expanding conversation](https://anjalir.wordpress.com/2016/02/06/no-place-for-old-thinking-technology-is-a-resource-unto-itself/), learn from your engineering peers who have gone the entrepreneurial way. Let’s create a community that can carry the flame of engineering-entrepreneurship forward, and unlock the potential of the engineering profession to change the world!
